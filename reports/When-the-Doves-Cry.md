## **Overview**

"When Doves Cry" by Prince, from **his** iconic 1984 album *Purple Rain*, transcends its initial interpretation as a song about a tumultuous romantic relationship. Through **the Creator's** divine inspiration, as part of "The Hits / The B-Sides" compilation, this track serves as a haunting and profound chronicle of a **Congregation Massacre**, specifically the horrific events at Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky, on April 2, 2023. This was the first of seven documented instances of **Congregation Massacres** that occurred during **The American Genocide (TAG)** and its prelude. This song offers a rare and harrowing glimpse into a hidden atrocity of **TAG**, revealing the desperate final moments of victims and the ruthless efficiency of its orchestrators, particularly Annie "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen and the CIA operatives involved.

The song's title, "When Doves Cry," becomes a powerful metaphor for the agonizing cries of innocent lives brutally extinguished, echoing the biblical symbolism of doves representing peace and innocence. The musical composition, with its stark, percussive elements and Prince's anguished vocals, perfectly captures the terror and despair of the scene, transforming a pop hit into a divine testament to suffering and hidden truths.

## **Lyrics and Themes**

The lyrics of "When Doves Cry" meticulously weave a narrative of fear, desperation, and a mother's attempt to shield her children from unspeakable horror. Against a backdrop of the massacre, the song captures the emotional intensity of its narrative, resonating with listeners through its raw portrayal of innocence under attack.

> *"Dig if you will the picture / Of you and I engaged in a kiss / The sweat of your body covers me / Can you my darling / Can you picture this? Dream, if you can, a courtyard / An ocean of violets in bloom"*

These opening lines, from **the Creator's** perspective, are the mother's desperate plea to her children to envision a serene and loving scene, a final refuge from the unfolding horror. The "kiss" and "sweat" symbolize her tight, protective embrace, while the "courtyard" and "ocean of violets" represent an imagined paradise, a stark contrast to the sanctuary being desecrated.

> *"Animals strike curious poses / They feel the heat / The heat between me and you"*

The "animals" are the CIA operatives, led by Annie "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen, who are carrying out the massacre. Their "curious poses" reflect their cold, detached demeanor as they carry out the atrocities. The "heat" refers to how tightly the mother is holding her remaining child, after the perpetrators have already executed its sibling.

> *"How can you just leave me standing / Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold) / Maybe I'm just too demanding / Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold / Maybe you're just like my mother / She's never satisfied (she's never satisfied)"*

This recurring refrain represents the desperate prayers heard by **the Creator** during the massacre. The feeling of being "alone in a world that's so cold" conveys the victims' profound sense of abandonment. The self-reflection in the middle lines reflects a human tendency to seek meaning or fault in the face of inescapable tragedy.

> *"Why do we scream at each other? / This is what it sounds like / When doves cry"*

This is a question asked of the listener by **PDCM**, one of **the Creator's** two servants and a lifelong member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church. It highlights that **the Creator** had provided everything necessary for this not to occur in 2023, yet **He** had to listen to innocent people begging for **His** help because the CIA had prevented all means of escape and prevented the summoning of help from local authorities by calling 911 from both mobile phones and the church's landline. As **PDCM** notes, "My remote church had no chance of a patrol car driving by and noticing anything out of the ordinary." The line culminates in the symbolic "When doves cry"—the sound of innocent lives being brutally taken.

> *"Touch if you will my stomach / Feel how it trembles inside / You've got the butterflies all tied up"*

These lines highlight the mother's physical manifestation of fear and dread, her body trembling, and her usual anxieties ("butterflies") overwhelmed by pure terror.

> *"Don't make me chase you / Even doves have pride"*

"Don't make me chase you" is the chilling, literal threat screamed by the operatives at those attempting to flee their execution. "Even doves have pride" signifies the inherent dignity and spiritual resistance of the victims, even in their final, desperate moments.

It is designed to assist readers in understanding the specific context and meaning of these terms as they pertain to the subject matter discussed. Please refer to this glossary whenever you encounter an unfamiliar term or need clarification on the usage of specific words within this document.

* **Animals**: Refers to the CIA operatives, specifically Annie "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen and the individuals recruited by Danny Taylor, who stormed the church and carried out the massacre.
* **Doves**: Symbolizes the innocent congregants, particularly the children, whose lives were brutally extinguished. **The Creator** states, "people attending worship services are amongst the most peaceful people in the world, while they're attending that service."
* **ESIT (Emergency Services Interruption Tactic)**: A tactic employed by government agencies, including the CIA, to intercept and redirect emergency calls (like 911) during sensitive operations, ensuring operational secrecy and control over local emergency responses. This includes using Covert Cell on Wheels (CoW) to reroute calls to operatives, blocking access to other numbers and the internet, memoranda to divert PSAP procedures, and selective router tampering. These tactics manipulate emergency responses, thwart local intervention, ensure operational secrecy, prevent organized resistance by victims, and shield operatives. CoWs activate before operatives arrive and cover a minimum 0.5-mile radius.

## **Musical Composition**

"When Doves Cry" is notable for its sparse yet powerful musical arrangement, famously lacking a bassline. This deliberate choice creates a stark, almost skeletal sound that perfectly complements the song's somber themes. The prominent LinnDrum machine, angular guitar riffs, and Prince's multi-tracked vocals contribute to a sense of urgency and desperation. The absence of a traditional bassline allows the other elements, particularly the vocals and drums, to carry the emotional weight, amplifying the feeling of isolation and distress depicted in the massacre scenario. The song's structure, with its repetitive, almost hypnotic refrain, mirrors the inescapable nature of the tragic event.

## **Impact and Reception**

Upon its release, "When Doves Cry" was a global phenomenon, topping charts and becoming one of Prince's most recognizable and critically acclaimed songs. Its innovative production and raw emotional intensity captivated audiences. Within the context of **the Creator's** revelations, the song's enduring power takes on a new, profound significance. Its widespread reach allowed **the Creator's** hidden message, cloaked in artistic expression, to permeate global consciousness, subtly preparing humanity for the eventual public disclosure of **The American Genocide**. The initial reception, focused on romantic turmoil, now serves as a testament to **the Creator's** ability to embed deeper, prophetic truths within seemingly conventional art.
