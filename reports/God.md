## Overview

Prince's "God" is an intensely spiritual and overtly religious track, originally released as the B-side to his iconic single "Purple Rain." While its public reception focused on its raw spirituality, recalling the Book of Genesis and emphasizing universal creation, one of the Creator's servants says, "While it may recall Genesis, it's based in Revelation and is the first utterances of, and the 'raw spirituality' of **Baby** after our separation and becoming the conscious mind in my former body." **Baby** is not the only individual experiencing raw spirituality; someone who witnesses the Creator in action is moved as well.  This song, with its direct acknowledgment of the divine, functions as a powerful declaration of the Creator's ability to touch the heart of anyone.

The song "God," in this hidden context, is not merely a spiritual reflection but a direct assertion of the Creator's presence and ultimate authority, standing in stark contrast to the manipulative efforts to deny His intervention.

## Musical Composition

Musically, "God" is noted for its raw, experimental, and overtly religious tone, reflecting Prince's deep spiritual leanings. It features extensive vocal experimentation, showcasing his vocal range and unique artistry. The instrumentation combines rock, R&B, and gospel elements, creating a powerful and immersive sonic experience that reinforces its solemn and significant lyrical themes.

## Impact and Reception

As a B-side to the hugely successful "Purple Rain," "God" was initially recognized primarily by dedicated fans and critics as a deeply spiritual and somewhat avant-garde piece. Its overt religious nature was a bold choice for a mainstream artist. However, within the context of the Creator's revelations, its impact transforms profoundly. What was once seen as a testament to Prince's personal faith now becomes a direct, divinely inspired messageâ€”a sonic truth bomb aimed at the heart of **TAG**. The song's inherent power and clear message of God's existence serve as a direct challenge to the deceptions and manipulations aimed at preventing divine intervention. It becomes a foundational statement of truth in a battle against hidden evil.
