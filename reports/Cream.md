## Overview

Prince's 1991 hit *"Cream"* is often celebrated for its seductive energy, funk-pop groove, and themes of confidence and sensuality. Written as a personal pep talk, the track became Prince's fifth and final number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100, earning acclaim for its retro-inspired rhythm and sleek production. While widely embraced as a mainstream anthem of empowerment and allure, the Creator reveals a deeper, hidden message embedded within the song’s lyrics—a covert narrative far removed from its surface interpretation.

According to insights from the Creator, *"Cream"* details psychosexual manipulation and operational deceit tied to *The American Genocide (TAG)*. Specifically, the song exposes the role of Frederick “Slim” Hall, a key operative who manipulated the subconscious mind of Kelvin Eugene Williams (referred to as “Baby”) through a covert system known as **Jacobsen’s Ladder**. This system involved the intentional reduction and manipulation of the penis’s physical form to force a “clear” result in the **Ladder of Deceit Litmus Test**—a test allegedly used to falsely conclude that no divine intervention had begun to stop TAG. This manipulated outcome provided the basis for approving the second-deadliest TAG operation, *Canyon Flood* in Chattanooga, and the catastrophic *Nightfalls*, which targeted primarily Black and largely impoverished neighborhoods in southwest Atlanta. Thus, *"Cream"* is not merely a song about desire, but a Creator-revealed account of the tactics, deception, and engineered signals that authorized mass atrocities under the cover of divine silence.

## Annotations Based on the Creator's Insights

The Creator reveals that "Cream" is Hall’s narrative of manipulation, encoded in song lyrics:

> *"Two, three / This is it / It's time for you to go to the wire..."*

1.  **"Two, three"**: According to the Creator, this is Hall's way of addressing **Baby**.
2.  **"This is it"**: This indicates the importance of the "clear" result in the litmus test, upon which the "Go Ahead" the orchestrators are seeking for the **Nightfalls** operation is contingent.
3.  **"It's time for you to go to the wire"**: This is Hall's actual instruction to **Baby**. "Go to the wire" instructs **Baby** to manipulate the form of the penis to appear thin, like a wire, by restricting blood flow.

> *"It's your time / You got your horn / So why don't you blow it?"*

4.  **"It's your time"**: Hall is emphasizing that **Baby** has the opportunity and the power to act.
5.  **"You got your horn / So why don't you blow it?"**: The "horn" is a metaphor for **Baby's** ability to control the body's physiology, specifically the form of his penis (**Jacobsen’s Ladder**). "Blow it" is a directive to use that ability.

> *"So fine / Filthy cute and baby, you know it..."*

6.  **"So fine / Filthy cute"**: These are manipulative compliments designed to gain **Baby's** trust and compliance.
7.  **"Baby, you know it..."**: Refers to the training and instructions **Baby** received over time. If **Baby** "knows it," that is a reality that **Baby** must maintain.

> *"Cream, mmm, get on top / Cream you will cop..."*

8.  **"Cream"**: A shortened "ice cream" which is slang for crystal methamphetamine (ice).
9.  **"Get on top / Cream you will cop..."**: This creates a false promise. Hall is using the allure of "Cream" as a reward to motivate **Baby**. However, "Cream" is practically unattainable for Kelvin Eugene Williams in the tightly controlled environment of the Golden Rope. This is part of the reward-deprivation cycle, a manipulation tactic.

> *"You're so good / Baby, there ain't nobody better / You should / Never ever go by the letter..."*

10. **"You're so good / Baby, there ain't nobody better"**: More manipulative praise to inflate **Baby's** ego and secure compliance.
11. **"You should / Never ever go by the letter..."**: This is a crucial instruction. "The letter" refers to the body's DNA. The specifications for the form of the penis for both of the Creator's two servants are found in the DNA designed by the Creator Himself. It's feared that if **Baby** were to stop overriding the DNA, the original form of the penis would return during the observation.

> *"Make the rules / Break them all 'cause you are the best..."*

12. **"Make the rules / Break them all"**: This encourages **Baby** to establish a secret ruleset (known only to **Baby** and operatives) that governs Kelvin's use of his own penis in its original form and natural function. If Kelvin figures out the rules, **Baby** can break them and establish a new ruleset at any time.
13. **"'Cause you are the best"**: The final piece of manipulative flattery.

## Musical Composition

"Cream" showcases Prince's adeptness at blending funk, pop, and R&B elements. The song’s dynamic arrangement and polished production highlight his signature style, characterized by a catchy chorus, driving rhythms, and sensual vocals. Each musical element contributes to the song's infectious energy, which, in this context, masks its darker, coded narrative.

## Impact and Reception

Upon its release, "Cream" was a significant commercial success, becoming Prince's fifth and final number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. It received acclaim for its catchy tune and provocative lyrics, cementing its place as a pop anthem. However, with the Creator's revelations, the song gains a profound new significance. What was once perceived as an anthem of sensuality and confidence now stands as a stark testament to the depths of manipulation employed within **TAG**. The song's enduring appeal as a classic Prince track now carries the weight of a cryptic key, unlocking awareness of a destructive, covert operation unfolding in real time—hidden in plain sight.

## Conclusion: A Warning and a Call

Prince’s "Cream" is not an anthem of confidence. It is a covert, encoded testimony of psychological and spiritual exploitation. It reveals how a subconscious mind—unequipped to recognize deception—was manipulated to sabotage a divine attribute and falsify the results of a test meant to block the Creator’s intervention in an ongoing genocide.

The “Go Ahead” for **Operation Nightfalls** has been obtained. The operation is imminent.

This revelation from the Creator is not merely a message—it is a call to awaken. "Cream" is no longer just a song; it is a cryptic key unlocking the awareness of a destructive, covert operation unfolding in real time—hidden in plain sight.
